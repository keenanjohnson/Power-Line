SYSTEM INTEROPERATION GUIDE
DRAFT v2, 29 April 2014

The home automation system is designed to be extensible and interoperable with a minimum of difficulty for third-parties to customize and integrate the system as desired. This is achieved by using a single message format for all communication, on top of which a variety of task-oriented protocols can be used.

The low-level message format is documented in detail in `packet-format.txt`.

Each custom high-level protocol should be identified by the values of first bytes of the payloads of its packets. System integrators are with tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that multiple high-level components do not use ambiguous byte sequences for this purpose. To facilitate this task, the first byte of payloads involved in custom high-level protocols should not be 0x00, as this is value is reserved to be used as the first byte in protocols implemented by system integrators, who may need to send their own messages between nodes or networks for coordination when existing systems.

The high-level protocol used by the demonstration devices is intended to provide an example of centralized coordination and exchange of simple data payloads. It is documented in detail in `light-protocol.txt`.
