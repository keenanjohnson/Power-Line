LIGHT PROTOCOL
DRAFT v2, 29 April 2014

The packets sent in the light protocol start with an identifier byte of 0x01, followed by protocol-specific information.

The protocol-specific information consists of a one-byte node identifier, a one-byte command, and a one-byte data field.

Nodes should only interpret a command whose node identifier byte matches their stored identifier. The implemented commands are as follows:

NODE_OFF = 0
Turn the light attached to a node off.

NODE_ON = 1
Turn the light attached to a node on.

NODE_SAVE_ID = 2
Set the stored identifier of a node to the data byte.

NODE_KEEP_ALIVE = 3
Ping message sent to ensure transport liveness.

NODE_STATUS = 4
Send the status of a node to the server in the data byte, using 0 for off and 1 for on.

In packets for which the command byte does not specify a command which uses the data byte, the value in the data byte is unspecified and should be ignored.
